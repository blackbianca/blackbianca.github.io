# 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}**, currently based in **{{ site.author.location }}**.  
I’m passionate about **radio astronomy**, **data science**, and **open-source software**.

When I’m not staring at pulsar data, I enjoy writing, hiking, and tinkering with small code projects.

If you’d like to collaborate or just say hi, feel free to reach out:
- ✉️ [{{ site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }})
- 💼 [LinkedIn]({{ site.social_links.linkedin }})
