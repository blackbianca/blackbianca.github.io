Here’s a closer look at my current work.

## HI in star-forming galaxies beyond the Local Universe
Constraining HI properties of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshift, with stacking. Gathering clues on the evolution of the baryon cycle throughout cosmic time

- [MHI-M* scaling relation: ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1b8)
- [HIMF and Cosmic Density: ](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250611280S/abstract)

## HI in passive galaxies
Neutral hydrogen fuels star formation, but does it stick around in quiescent galaxies? If so, what traces it?

## Spectral Stacking Pipeline
A code designed to stack low signal-to-noise spectra to detect mean information on HI content at intermediate redshift, in radio data.  
Built with **Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib**.

## EDFS MeerKAT - data reduction
Using *[Caracal](https://caracal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)* to reduce L1 MeerKAT data on the Euclid Deep Field South: preparing for the biggest HI stacking experiment ever?
Work in progress.

## superMIGHTEE - stacking at z=1
Interactive 3D visualization of large-scale cosmic structure.  
[View Survey Paper]([https://github.com/blackbianca/cosmicwebviz](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf6dc)).
Work in progress.
