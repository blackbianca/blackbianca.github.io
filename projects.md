Here’s a closer look at my current work.

### Spectral Stacking Pipeline
A code designed to stack low signal-to-noise spectra to detect mean information on HI content at intermediate redshift, in radio data.  
Built with **Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib**.

### EDFS MeerKAT - data reduction
Using *[Caracal](https://caracal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)* to reduce L1 MeerKAT data on the Euclid Deep Field South: preparing for the biggest HI stacking experiment ever?
Work in progress.

### superMIGHTEE - stacking at z=1
Interactive 3D visualization of large-scale cosmic structure.  
[View Survey Paper]([https://github.com/blackbianca/cosmicwebviz](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf6dc)).
Work in progress.
